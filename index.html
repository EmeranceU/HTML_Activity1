            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.</p>
            <p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library that covers many areas such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.</p>
            <p>Some key features of Python include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Easy to learn and use with a clean, readable syntax</li>
              <li>Interpreted language, no need to compile before running</li>
              <li>Dynamically typed, you don't need to declare variable types</li>
            </ul>
